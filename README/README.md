#Quick Sort

Quick Sort divides a large array into two sub-arrays containing low elements and high elements. First it selects an element from the array as a pivot. Then it reorders elements around the pivot by comparing their values. Lesser values come before the pivot and greater values come after. This is recursively applied to the subsections until the array is sorted.
