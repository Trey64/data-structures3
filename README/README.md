#Associative Array

Before starting, I had no idea how to  implement an associative array. Reading up on it, I learned that it consists of a collection of (key, value) pairs. I learned about the dictionary problem, which maintains a set of data during search, delete, and insert operations. The two major solutions are a hash table or search tree. .NET Core has associative arrays built-in, like Dictionary, but we couldn't use them. So we tried to create our own, setting up pairs of movies and the people who rent them. Unfortunately we couldn't figure it out, and probably went about it all wrong. Will have to revisit this in the future.

The resources we used were:
