#Nth of Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is something I've seen before, without even knowing what it was. It's a sequence where the next number in a series of numbers is calculated by adding the two numbers before it.
So our rule is x~n = x~n-1 + x~n-2.
Our method takes in N as a parameter. If N is less than or equal to 1, it returns N. We then return the sum of the previous 2 numbers by using recursion.
The resources we utilized had helpful information and diagrams that helped us to understand it better.
