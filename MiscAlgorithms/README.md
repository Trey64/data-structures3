#Nth of Fibonacci

The Fibonacci sequence is something I've seen before, without even knowing what it was. It's a sequence where the next number in a series of numbers is calculated by adding the two numbers before it.
So our rule is Xn = Xn-1 + Xn-2.
Our method takes in n as a parameter. If n is less than or equal to 1, it returns n. We then return the sum of the previous 2 numbers by using recursion.
The resources we utilized had helpful information and diagrams that helped us to understand it better.
