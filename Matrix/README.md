Going into this challenge, I was unfamiliar with multidimensional arrays. We looked at the resources below to learn more, as well as some youtube videos. For our implementation, first we wanted to find the element containing zero. Then we want to change everything in the same index to zero. We tried to start with a small 2x2 matrix to make it simpler, but our solution isn't working so we will have to try a different approach.
