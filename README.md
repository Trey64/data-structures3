# Breadth First Traversal
- For this challenge, we utilized various resources.
- https://www.cs.bu.edu/teaching/c/tree/breadth-first/ - This was our first resource, and it taught us what breadth first traversal is and when we'd use it.
- https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/7977ey2c(v=vs.110).aspx - We used this doc to learn about the built-in Queue class and the properties/methods that are available.
- https://jamesmccaffrey.wordpress.com/2011/10/22/breadth-first-and-depth-first-traversal-of-a-c-binary-search-tree/ - We got our solution from this blog, which uses a queue to implement breadth-first traversal.
