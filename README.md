#Sorted Array to Balanced Binary Tree

Before starting I felt kind of lost, but we found a great resource while researching and our whiteboard helped a lot. I learned how to find the middle of a sorted array and 
make it the root, then recursively doing the same for the left and right halves of the tree and making them the left/right child. With our new BST, we then do a preorder traversal
write it out to the console.

The resource we used was:
