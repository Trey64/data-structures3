#Deleting a node in a binary search tree

Before starting the challenge, I felt like I was starting to understand binary search trees a little bit better because finding the min and max was pretty easy.
Deletion was a lot more difficult, and I don't think I've fully grasped it yet. However, I did learn that there are three possibilities when deleting a node:
The node is a a leaf with no children, the node has one child, or the node has two children. We whiteboarded a diagram and some pseudocode. Our main guideline was the geeksforgeeks article.

The resources we used were:
